# Riddler

Riddler is a dynamic content and workflow engine.


## Example

```ruby
require "riddler"

step_definition = {
  "id"=>"st_1F0jZG9Wtzx",
  "object"=>"content",
  "elements"=>[
    {"id"=>"el_1F0jZjWQenOW", "text"=>"Hello {{ params.name }}", "object"=>"copy"}
  ]
}

preview = Riddler::UseCases::PreviewStep.new step_definition, params: { name: "World" }

content = preview.process

# {:type=>"content",
# :id=>"st_1F0jZG9Wtzx",
# "elements"=>[{:type=>"copy", :id=>"el_1F0jZjWQenOW", :text=>"Hello World!"}]}
```

### PokeAPI ContextBuilder example

One way Riddler can be extended is by adding new `ContextBuilder`s.
Let's add the ability to look up a Pokemon at https://pokeapi.co/

We will then pass in a `pokemon_id` as a param

```ruby
require "riddler"
require "net/http"

class PokemonContextBuilder < ::Riddler::ContextBuilder
  def process
    return unless context.params.pokemon_id

    pokemon_id = context.params.pokemon_id
    uri = URI "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/#{pokemon_id}/"
    response_string = Net::HTTP.get uri
    response = JSON.parse response_string

    context.assign "pokemon", response
  end
end

Riddler.configure { |c| c.context_builders << PokemonContextBuilder }

step_definition = {
  "id"=>"st_1F0jZG9Wtzx",
  "object"=>"content",
  "elements"=>[
    {"id"=>"el_1F0jZjWQenOW", "text"=>"Pokemon name {{ pokemon.name }}", "object"=>"copy"}
  ]
}

preview = Riddler::UseCases::PreviewStep.new step_definition, params: { pokemon_id: "1" }

content = preview.process

# {:type=>"content",
# :id=>"st_1F0jZG9Wtzx",
# "elements"=>[{:type=>"copy", :id=>"el_1F0jZjWQenOW", :text=>"Pokemon name bulbasaur"}]}

```
